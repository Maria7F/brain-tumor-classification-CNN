# Brain Tumor Classification CNN

#### Data:
* Brain Tumors are classified as: Benign Tumor, Malignant Tumor, Pituitary Tumor, etc. Proper treatment, planning, and accurate diagnostics should be implemented to improve the life expectancy of the patients. The best technique to detect brain tumors is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). A huge amount of image data is generated through the scans. These images are examined by the radiologist. A manual examination can be error-prone due to the level of complexities involved in brain tumors and their properties.

#### Question/need:
* What is the kind of the tumor

#### Data Description:
* The folder contains MRI data. The images are already split into Training and Testing folders.
Each folder has more four subfolders. These folders have MRIs of respective tumor classes.


#### Tools:
*	Matplotlib for visualization
*	Numpy for computing 
*	Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
*	Tensorflow for machine learning and artificial intelligence
*	Sklearn, machine learning library
*	OpenCV for real-time computer vision
